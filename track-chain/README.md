## üìã Usage Guide

### 1. Stakeholder Registration

First, stakeholders must register with the system:

```clarity
;; Register as a manufacturer
(contract-call? .supply-chain register-stakeholder 
  u1                           ;; STAKEHOLDER-MANUFACTURER
  "Acme Manufacturing Co."     ;; company-name
  "contact@acme.com"          ;; contact-info
  (list "ISO9001" "FDA")      ;; certifications
)
```

### 2. Create Production Batch

Manufacturers create production batches:

```clarity
;; Create a new batch
(contract-call? .supply-chain create-batch
  "BATCH-2024-001"            ;; batch-number
  u1000                       ;; total-quantity
  "Grade-A"                   ;; quality-grade
  "Factory-NY"                ;; production-location
  (list "Steel" "Aluminum")   ;; raw-materials
  (list "ISO9001")           ;; certifications
)
```

### 3. Create Products

Link individual products to batches:

```clarity
;; Create a product from the batch
(contract-call? .supply-chain create-product
  "Premium Widget"            ;; product-name
  "Electronics"              ;; product-category
  u1                         ;; batch-id
  u2000000                   ;; expiry-date (block height)
  "USA"                      ;; origin-country
  "High-quality electronic widget"  ;; description
  u50000                     ;; base-price (micro-STX)
  "Factory-NY-Line-1"        ;; initial-location
)
```

### 4. Track Product Movement

Update product status as it moves through the supply chain:

```clarity
;; Update product status to in-transit
(contract-call? .supply-chain update-product-status
  u1                         ;; product-id
  u5                         ;; STATUS-IN-TRANSIT
  "Highway I-95, Mile 150"   ;; new-location
  'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7  ;; new-holder
  (some u72)                 ;; temperature (optional)
  (some u45)                 ;; humidity (optional)
  "Shipped via TruckCorp"    ;; notes
)
```

### 5. Add Verifications

Third-party verifiers can add verification records:

```clarity
;; Add quality verification
(contract-call? .supply-chain add-verification
  u1                         ;; product-id
  u1                         ;; VERIFICATION-QUALITY
  true                       ;; verification-result
  "Passed all quality tests" ;; verification-data
  u2100000                   ;; expiry-time
  none                       ;; certificate-hash
  "Verified by QualityCorps" ;; notes
)
```

### 6. Monitor Temperature

For temperature-sensitive products:

```clarity
;; Record temperature reading
(contract-call? .supply-chain record-temperature
  u1                         ;; product-id
  u38                        ;; temperature (Celsius)
  u60                        ;; humidity (%)
  "Refrigerated Truck #123"  ;; location
  u35                        ;; min-temp
  u40                        ;; max-temp
)
```

## üîç Query Functions

```clarity
;; Get complete product details
(contract-call? .supply-chain get-product u1)

;; Get supply chain summary
(contract-call? .supply-chain get-supply-chain-summary u1)

;; Verify product authenticity
(contract-call? .supply-chain verify-product-authenticity u1)
